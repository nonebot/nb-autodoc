"""Python Code Analyzer by parsing and analyzing AST.

Stub file:

    Stub files are written in normal Python 3 syntax, but generally leaving out
    runtime logic like variable initializers, function bodies, and default arguments.

    So expected stub files are safe and executable. In the code analysis procedure,
    stub file do the same stuff as source file.
